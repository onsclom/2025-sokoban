fun things to do:

- level selector (2d grid to make it easier)
- track whether levels have been completed in local storage ?
- progress % ?

- click to take unobstructed path to places

- make solver to figure out if level is still solveable ?? (and suggest undo if so?)
  - if this is slow to compute, do it in a web worker






THINGS TO POSSIBLY DO NEXT:
- 1v1 race (online or local mult)
  - chooses a rando level from the 90
- clicking to moving
- level select screen
  - marking if levels completed (in localstorage)
- make a solver
  - suggesting undo
  - better level generation maybe?
- hats, easter eggs
- reverse sokoban manual mode to generate levels
  - make way to upload and share levels??
  - load levels by url param
- mobile controls
- winning animation CONFETTI
- dust particles when moving
